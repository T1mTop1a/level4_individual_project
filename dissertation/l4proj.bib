	abstract = {The increase in publication rates makes it challenging for an individual researcher to stay abreast of all relevant research in order to find novel research hypotheses. Literature-based discovery methods make use of knowledge graphs built using text mining and can infer future associations between biomedical concepts that will likely occur in new publications. These predictions are a valuable resource for researchers to explore a research topic. Current methods for prediction are based on the local structure of the knowledge graph. A method that uses global knowledge from across the knowledge graph needs to be developed in order to make knowledge discovery a frequently used tool by researchers.We propose an approach based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) that is able to combine data from across the knowledge graph through a reduced representation. Using cooccurrence data extracted from published literature, we show that SVD performs better than the leading methods for scoring discoveries. We also show the diminishing predictive power of knowledge discovery as we compare our predictions with real associations that appear further into the future. Finally, we examine the strengths and weaknesses of the SVD approach against another well-performing system using several predicted associations.All code and results files for this analysis can be accessed at https://github.com/jakelever/knowledgediscovery.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Objective:
We explore the framing of literature-based discovery (LBD) as link prediction and graph embedding learning, with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) as our focus disease context. The key link prediction setting of prediction window length is specifically examined in the context of a time-sliced evaluation methodology.
Methods:
We propose a four-stage approach to explore literature-based discovery for Alzheimer’s Disease, creating and analyzing a knowledge graph tailored to the AD context, and predicting and evaluating new knowledge based on time-sliced link prediction. The first stage is to collect an AD-specific corpus. The second stage involves constructing an AD knowledge graph with identified AD-specific concepts and relations from the corpus. In the third stage, 20 pairs of training and testing datasets are constructed with the time-slicing methodology. Finally, we infer new knowledge with graph embedding-based link prediction methods. We compare different link prediction methods in this context. The impact of limiting prediction evaluation of LBD models in the context of short-term and longer-term knowledge evolution for Alzheimer’s Disease is assessed.
Results:
We constructed an AD corpus of over 16 k papers published in 1977–2021, and automatically annotated it with concepts and relations covering 11 AD-specific semantic entity types. The knowledge graph of Alzheimer’s Disease derived from this resource consisted of ∼11 k nodes and ∼394 k edges, among which 34\% were genotype-phenotype relationships, 57\% were genotype-genotype relationships, and 9\% were phenotype-phenotype relationships. A Structural Deep Network Embedding (SDNE) model consistently showed the best performance in terms of returning the most confident set of link predictions as time progresses over 20 years. A huge improvement in model performance was observed when changing the link prediction evaluation setting to consider a more distant future, reflecting the time required for knowledge accumulation.
Conclusion:
Neural network graph-embedding link prediction methods show promise for the literature-based discovery context, although the prediction setting is extremely challenging, with graph densities of less than 1\%. Varying prediction window length on the time-sliced evaluation methodology leads to hugely different results and interpretations of LBD studies. Our approach can be generalized to enable knowledge discovery for other diseases.

Hence, we need a text-mining system that helps users explore various types of (possibly hidden) associations in an easy and comprehensible manner.Results: This article describes FACTA+, a real-time text-mining system for finding and visualizing indirect associations between biomedical concepts from MEDLINE abstracts. The system can be used as a text search engine like PubMed with additional features to help users discover and visualize indirect associations between important biomedical concepts such as genes, diseases and chemical compounds. FACTA+ inherits all functionality from its predecessor, FACTA, and extends it by incorporating three new features: (i) detecting biomolecular events in text using a machine learning model, (ii) discovering hidden associations using co-occurrence statistics between concepts, and (iii) visualizing associations to improve the interpretability of the output. To the best of our knowledge, FACTA+ is the first real-time web application that offers the functionality of finding concepts involving biomolecular events and visualizing indirect associations of concepts with both their categories and importance.Availability: FACTA+ is available as a web application at http://refine1-nactem.mc.man.ac.uk/facta/, and its visualizer is available at http://refine1-nactem.mc.man.ac.uk/facta-visualizer/.Contact:  tsuruoka@jaist.ac.jp},

	abstract = {High-quality medical systematic reviews require comprehensive literature searches to ensure the recommendations and outcomes are sufficiently reliable. Indeed, searching for relevant medical literature is a key phase in constructing systematic reviews and often involves domain (medical researchers) and search (information specialists) experts in developing the search queries. Queries in this context are highly complex, based on Boolean logic, include free-text terms and index terms from standardised terminologies (e.g., the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus), and are difficult and time-consuming to build. The use of MeSH terms, in particular, has been shown to improve the quality of the search results. However, identifying the correct MeSH terms to include in a query is difficult: information experts are often unfamiliar with the MeSH database and unsure about the appropriateness of MeSH terms for a query. Naturally, the full value of the MeSH terminology is often not fully exploited. This article investigates methods to suggest MeSH terms based on an initial Boolean query that includes only free-text terms. In this context, we devise lexical and pre-trained language models based methods. These methods promise to automatically identify highly effective MeSH terms for inclusion in a systematic review query. Our study contributes an empirical evaluation of several MeSH term suggestion methods. We further contribute an extensive analysis of MeSH term suggestions for each method and how these suggestions impact the effectiveness of Boolean queries.},

	abstract = {Literature-based discovery (LBD) aims to discover valuable latent relationships between disparate sets of literatures. This paper presents the first inclusive scientometric overview of LBD research. We utilize a comprehensive scientometric approach incorporating CiteSpace to systematically analyze the literature on LBD from the last four decades (1986–2020). After manual cleaning, we have retrieved a total of 409 documents from six bibliographic databases and two preprint servers. The 35 years’ history of LBD could be partitioned into three phases according to the published papers per year: incubation (1986–2003), developing (2004–2008), and mature phase (2009–2020). The annual production of publications follows Price’s law. The co-authorship network exhibits many subnetworks, indicating that LBD research is composed of many small and medium-sized groups with little collaboration among them. Science mapping reveals that mainstream research in LBD has shifted from baseline co-occurrence approaches to semantic-based methods at the beginning of the new millennium. In the last decade, we can observe the leaning of LBD towards modern network science ideas. In an applied sense, the LBD is increasingly used in predicting adverse drug reactions and drug repurposing. Besides theoretical considerations, the researchers have put a lot of effort into the development of Web-based LBD applications. Nowadays, LBD is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and involves methods from information science, scientometrics, and machine learning. Unfortunately, LBD is mainly limited to the biomedical domain. The cascading citation expansion announces deep learning and explainable artificial intelligence as emerging topics in LBD. The results indicate that LBD is still growing and evolving.},

Text mining tools and methods represents automatic approaches for extracting hidden patterns and trends from this semi structured and unstructured data. In Biomedical Text mining, Literature Based Discovery (LBD) is the process of automatically discovering novel associations between medical terms otherwise mentioned in disjoint literature sets. LBD approaches proven to be successfully reducing the discovery time of potential associations that are hidden in the vast amount of scientific literature. The process focuses on creating concept profiles for medical terms such as a disease or symptom and connecting it with a drug and treatment based on the statistical significance of the shared profiles. This knowledge discovery approach introduced in 1989 still remains as a core task in text mining. Currently the ABC principle based two approaches namely open discovery and closed discovery are mostly explored in LBD process. This review starts with general introduction about text mining followed by biomedical text mining and introduces various literature resources such as MEDLINE, UMLS, MESH, and SemMedDB. This is followed by brief introduction of the core ABC principle and its associated two approaches open discovery and closed discovery in LBD process. This review also discusses the deep learning applications in LBD by reviewing the role of transformer models and neural networks based LBD models and its future aspects. Finally, reviews the key biomedical discoveries generated through LBD approaches in biomedicine and conclude with the current limitations and future directions of LBD.},

The reader will be capable of distinguishing between recent LBD systems and publications, and be capable of designing an LBD system for a specific application.
Target audience
From biomedical researchers curious about LBD, to someone looking to design an LBD system, to an LBD expert trying to catch up on trends in the field. The reader need not be familiar with LBD, but knowledge of biomedical text processing tools is helpful.
Scope
This paper describes a unifying framework for LBD systems. Within this framework, different models and methods are presented to both distinguish and show overlap between systems. Topics include term and document representation, system components, and an overview of models including co-occurrence models, semantic models, and distributional models. Other topics include uninformative term filtering, term ranking, results display, system evaluation, an overview of the application areas of drug development, drug repurposing, and adverse drug event prediction, and challenges and future directions. A timeline showing contributions to LBD, and a table summarizing the works of several authors is provided. Topics are presented from a high level perspective. References are given if more detailed analysis is required.},

	abstract = {While medical researchers formulate new hypotheses to test, they need to identify connections to their work from other parts of the medical literature. However, the current volume of information has become a great barrier for this task. Recently, many literature-based discovery (LBD) systems have been developed to help researchers identify new knowledge that bridges gaps across distinct sections of the medical literature. Each LBD system uses different methods for mining the connections from text and ranking the identified connections, but none of the currently available LBD evaluation approaches can be used to compare the effectiveness of these methods. In this paper, we present an evaluation methodology for LBD systems that allows comparisons across different systems. We demonstrate the abilities of our evaluation methodology by using it to compare the performance of different correlation-mining and ranking approaches used by existing LBD systems. This evaluation methodology should help other researchers compare approaches, make informed algorithm choices, and ultimately help to improve the performance of LBD systems overall.},

Since then, there have been many approaches to mine undiscovered public knowledge from biomedical literature. This paper presents a semantic-based approach for mining undiscovered public knowledge from biomedical literature. The method takes advantages of the biomedical ontologies, MeSH and UMLS, as the source of semantic knowledge. A prototype system Biomedical Semantic-based Knowledge Discovery System (Bio-SbKDS) is designed to uncover novel hypothesis/connections hidden in the biomedical literature. Using the semantic types and semantic relations of the biomedical concepts, Bio-SbKDS can identify the relevant concepts collected from Medline and generate the novel hypothesis between these concepts. Bio-SbKDS successfully replicates Dr. Swanson's two famous discoveries: Raynaud disease/fish oil and migraine/magnesium. Compared with previous approaches, our method searches much less articles, generates much less but more relevant novel hypotheses, requires much less human intervention in the discovery procedure.},

	abstract = {Literature-based discovery (LBD) combines known facts in the scientiﬁc literature to generate discoveries, or hypotheses. Potential discoveries have the form of relations between concepts; for example, in the biomedical domain (on which we concentrate), a drug may be determined to treat a disease other than the one for which it was intended. We view the domain knowledge underpinning LBD as a network consisting of a set of concepts along with the relations connecting them. In the study presented here, we used SemMedDB, a database of semantic relations between biomedical concepts extracted with SemRep from MEDLINE. SemMedDB is distributed as a MySQL relational database, which is not optimal for dealing with network data. We transformed and uploaded SemMedDB into a Neo4j graph database, and implemented the basic LBD discovery algorithms with the Cypher query language. We conclude that storing the data needed for semantic LBD is facilitated by a graph database. Also, implementing LBD discovery algorithms is conceptually simpler with a graph query language when compared with standard SQL.},

In detail, the topology of the proposed HDNN architecture follows the exact hierarchical structure of the label set to integrate this knowledge directly into the DNN. We assumed that if a label set hierarchy is available, as in the case of the PubMed Dataset, forcing this information into the network topology could enhance the classification performances and the interpretability of the results, especially related to the hierarchy. We performed an experimental assessment of the PubMed article classification task, demonstrating that the proposed HDNN provides performance improvement for a baseline based on a classic flat Convolution Neural Network (CNN) deep learning architecture, in particular in terms of hierarchical measures. These results provide useful hints for integrating previous and innate knowledge in a deep neural network. The drawback of the HDNN is the high computational time required to train the neural network, which can be addressed with a parallel implementation planned as a future work.},

Some related work not on NMF that NMF should learn from or has connections with is involved too. Moreover, some open issues remained to be solved are discussed. Several relevant application areas of NMF are also briefly described. This survey aims to construct an integrated, state-of-the-art framework for NMF concept, from which the follow-up research may benefit.},

These systems passively track different sorts of user behavior, such as purchase history, watching habits and browsing activity, in order to model user preferences. Unlike the much more extensively researched explicit feedback, we do not have any direct input from the users regarding their preferences. In particular, we lack substantial evidence on which products consumer dislike. In this work we identify unique properties of implicit feedback datasets. We propose treating the data as indication of positive and negative preference associated with vastly varying confidence levels. This leads to a factor model which is especially tailored for implicit feedback recommenders. We also suggest a scalable optimization procedure, which scales linearly with the data size. The algorithm is used successfully within a recommender system for television shows. It compares favorably with well tuned implementations of other known methods. In addition, we offer a novel way to give explanations to recommendations given by this factor model.},

The most recent studies fulfilled the task by learning the representations of the concepts and using the representations’ similarities to decide whether a connecting concept is a reasonable one. However, these approaches cannot handle “complex” associations with multiple connecting concepts properly. To address this issue, we propose a neural network model LBDSetNet which can assign a “credibility” score to a plausible association with either one or more connecting concepts. By unifying both the literature and the candidate associations as bags of concepts, we can generate “less credible” literature and train LBDSetNet by enforcing it to distinguish the generated and original literature, overcoming the lack of labeled associations. We also propose a new double-margin cost function for better model training by generating “more credible” documents. We experiment to show that our model can find “complex” associations effectively and efficiently. Comparative experiments reveal that the LBDSetNet solution performs significantly better than the previously proposed models on “simple” associations. The double margin cost function also proves its advantage in model training.},

In this paper we present several improvements that make the Skip-gram model more expressive and enable it to learn higher quality vectors more rapidly.  We show that by subsampling frequent words we obtain significant speedup,  and also learn higher quality representations as measured by our tasks. We also introduce Negative Sampling, a simplified variant of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) that learns more accurate vectors for frequent words compared to the hierarchical softmax.   An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases.  For example, the meanings of Canada'' and "Air'' cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada''.  Motivated by this example, we present a simple and efficient method for finding phrases, and show that their vector representations can be accurately learned by the Skip-gram model. "},
